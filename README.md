This case study analyzes how product changes impact customer support using SQL. I examined support call logs alongside product event dates to understand how two releases (Billing Workflow Update and the Login MFA Rollout) affected call volume, call length, and the types of issues customers contacted support about.

While daily call volume remained relatively stable after both events, the types of issues customers were calling about changed. After the Billing Workflow Update, billing-related calls per day increased by 38% and average billing call length increased by 24%, indicating a shift toward more billing-related support and longer calls. Following the Login MFA Rollout, login-related calls per day increased by 17% and average login call length increased by 14%, indicating customers needed more support navigating the new login experience.

## Key Findings
	•	Product changes can increase support complexity even when total call volume remains stable
	•	Product releases can shift the types of support issues and call complexity even when overall call volume stays stable
	•	Per-day metrics provide clearer comparisons when analyzing product changes

## Recommendations
	•	Prepare support teams with targeted training ahead of major releases
	•	Provide clear customer-facing resources such as FAQs or walkthroughs
	•	Monitor support metrics closely after launches to catch customer friction early and reduce customer churn
